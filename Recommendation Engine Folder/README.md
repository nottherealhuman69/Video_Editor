# Video Filter/Transition Recommendation Engine

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes a video and recommends appropriate **filters** or **transitions** at specific moments. It aims to assist in automating creative decision-making for video editing and post-production workflows.

## Objective

The primary objective of this notebook is to:
- Load and process a video file.
- Extract relevant visual and audio features.
- Detect significant moments such as scene changes or highlights.
- Recommend visual **filters** (e.g., grayscale, sepia) and **transitions** (e.g., fade-in, zoom) accordingly.

This tool is particularly beneficial for:
- Automatic video editing systems.
- Enhancing short-form content for social media platforms.
- Streamlining professional editing pipelines.

## File Structure

```
├── Recommendation_Engine.ipynb  # Main notebook for analysis and recommendation
├── sample_video.mp4             # Example video file (user-supplied)
├── requirements.txt             # Python dependencies (auto-generable)
├── README.md                    # Project documentation
```

## Requirements

This project uses Python 3.8+ and the following libraries:

- opencv-python
- moviepy
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib
- librosa
- scipy
- tqdm
- torch (optional, for advanced ML models)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If using Jupyter, install it via:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Methodology

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Load the video and extract frames and audio.
2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Compute visual features (brightness, color, motion).
   - Analyze audio with `librosa` (e.g., energy, tempo).
3. **Key Moment Detection**
   - Detect scene changes or high-activity segments.
4. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Rule-based or ML-based decision logic to suggest filters or transitions.
5. **Visualization and Output**
   - Recommendations are printed with timestamps.
   - Optional plotting and previews.

## Sample Output

```
[00:00:05] → Transition: Fade-in
[00:00:22] → Filter: Grayscale
[00:01:00] → Transition: Zoom-out
```

## Usage Instructions

1. Place your video file in the working directory.
2. Open `Recommendation_Engine.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook sequentially to analyze and generate suggestions.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate deep learning for mood/emotion-based recommendations.
- Support export to editing software formats (e.g., Adobe Premiere XML, Final Cut Pro).
- GUI integration for interactive filter/transition customization.
